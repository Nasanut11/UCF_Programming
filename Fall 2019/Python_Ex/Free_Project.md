So I attempted the 11-1 Free Project for this assignment. It started with difficulties on the image
generation due to lack of pillow. Once I figured out that I needed to install the pip install pillow,
the operation of interation could begin. I began by generating just a plane black square that was 100 by 100
generating in python interactive. Once that was made, I created words in the square stating "Hello World." While
this is a simple text generation it gets the point across of creating text in an image. I then played around 
with the values of the RGBA to execute the result of white text on a black square background. After this, I attempted to execute a rotation function, and recieved a few errors. I eventually called it quits on that after some Google searches, and decided to submit.
