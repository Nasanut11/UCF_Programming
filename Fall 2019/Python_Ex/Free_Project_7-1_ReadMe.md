The free project I chose was 7-1; after much deliberation and attempts with the 7-3, I decided to switch to 7-1.
Once the switch occured I was able to create a program by openning the file in VSCode, and then editing the text from there.
The instructions in the book were not very clear, and neither were the instructions in the downloadable file. Changes I made were
"safe" in the sense that when changed, they would create a different output while still being a functional code. Being able to see
working code and changes pieces helps my understanding better than creating it from scratch (similar to the HTML class on the first
day of the semester). I changed the words to create new outputs for the sentences; choosing words mostly at random or from 
synonyms and antinyms. The output is surprisingly sentences that make sense as a piece, and more surprisingly as a whole.
