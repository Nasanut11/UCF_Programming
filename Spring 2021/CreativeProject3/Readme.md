This project was designed to fulfill the requirements laid out in the assingment - to create an audio visual instrument using p5.js. The idea changed a lot due to difficulties with getting things to work, so here we are. Originally the idea was to create an instrument that would play parts of the lyrics for Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" in place of the monotones (i.e. one lyric in place of one note or sound). Ultimately this did not pan out as I couldn't get it to function/did not have time to tinker with it. The final version seen here allows users to input any piece of text; whether it be word, sentence, or paragraph, to create "music" using each individual letter in a given word.
