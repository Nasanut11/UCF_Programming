So this project was a bit of a doozy... Hence the very late turn in of this project. The attempt was made to create a Amazon Lex Bot that would act as a useful aid while playing
the game Animal Crossings: New Horizons. Intents were created to do various tasks from generating a random flower and color, to getting the costs for in game items. While the hope
was to create something useful for myself later, unfortunately the bots/intents never worked. Screenshots are included that show the failed attempts, as well as the lambda function
being used. I wish that this had worked, let alone had worked in time for the due date, but unfortunately I need to turn in something so this is that.
