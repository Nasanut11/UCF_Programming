Firstly I saved the files as a "base" file to which I could edit and work from in case of errors.
Next I changed around the colours and speeds of the cars under the "myCar1" and "myCar2" sections, then realized that was not what was being asked and moved on to solving the actual issue. I did however leave the colours I changed for the cars.
I incorporated a random element into the "myCar1" colour section making the car change colours when randomly called upon by the code when ran. However, when ran a bunch of times the only colours seem to be grey scale... I don't know how to fix this, but I guess it could just be a distinguishing feature from the other car.
As for the "change an instance variable"  sections for this, I believe I did that. I honestly am not quite sure... I read through and executed the examples provided in "Objects in Processing.py" and could not understand what exactly an instance variable is. I then Googled the issue and found this website:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-class-and-instance-variables-in-python-3
This helped a bit, but still left me uncertain.

I attempted to initialize the program to run and restart on the spacebar button when pushed, however nothing happened. For references, I could not find any in Github for guidance, and when searching the internet it resulted in Processing.py's webpage. The "keyReleased" was the only page that said the code was not broken, so I attempted to proceed with those. Here are those pages:
https://py.processing.org/reference/keyReleased.html
https://py.processing.org/reference/keyPressed.html

I created a new class called "Cat", and made Cat1 though Cat6 varying the colours, placements, and speeds. Partially I wanted to see how fast the fastest number I could get was, so I made Cat6 go 1000 units per whatever and broke the code. All other cats raced off from the start, while I assume Cat6 was going so fast that the program gave up trying to render it.

For this problem I made an arbitrarry class titled "Bear". The colour I attempted to draw it as was (0, 255, 100), which I dont believe worked because it still came out black. I then attempted to change the background colour by making it (250, 100, 100), which did not work in the first "def draw" section, but did in the second one. It created this salmon coloured background, and then hindered the drawing of the mouse in the text box. I don't know why this is as there are no errors (seemingly) in the code, and Google yeilded no results for this issue...

I am not exactly clear as to what is being meant here and am assuming I'm missing some element in one of the previous examples. I've reread the past questions and cannot find anything different. So I'm lost for this one...
