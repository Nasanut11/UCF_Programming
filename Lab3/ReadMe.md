Firstly I saved the files as a "base" file to which I could edit and work from in case of errors.

Next I changed around the colours and speeds of the cars under the "myCar1" and "myCar2" sections, then realized that was not what was being asked and moved on to solving the actual issue. I did however leave the colours I changed for the cars.

I incorporated a random element into the "myCar1" colour section making the car change colours when randomly called upon by the code when ran. However, when ran a bunch of times the only colours seem to be grey scale... I don't know how to fix this, but I guess it could just be a distinguishing feature from the other car.
