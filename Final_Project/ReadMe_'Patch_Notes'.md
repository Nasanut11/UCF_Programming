TITLE: A KNIGHT, A MAGE, AND A JELLYBEAN WALK INTO A BAR
VERSION 1.5:

TITLE: A KNIGHT, A MAGE, AND A JELLYBEAN WALK INTO A BAR
VERSION 1.0: The story is complete, adding not just three endings, but five techniquly due to randomization implemented in the final choices. I have also "themed" certain parts of the story and changed the text to match that said sections.
Mage - Right Alignned
Knight - Left Alignned
Main/Start - Center Alignned
End - Center Alignned

TITLE: A KNIGHT, A MAGE, AND A JELLYBEAN WALK INTO A BAR
VERSION 0.5: I've created a basic fantasy narrative where the player can choose to become either a Knight or a Mage. Through the narratives of either side of the story, they will be given choices to pick guiding the story. Both points will converge at certain points of the "main story" and then have more choices.

CONCEPT 0.1
SUMMARY: The bulk of the project changed mostly due to the Processing example "Planets" is soley a Java based program and cannot be run under Python. In order to use that example to build from I'd have to convert the entire program to Python, or learn enough Java to change the program. So I decided that I would switch over to creating an interactive story in Twine. Using HTML, I will attempt to create a story that is non-linear, grasping more experience in HTML and in narrative creation. 

FEATURES:
1. Create a cohesive narrative with at least three endings through a "player lead" story.
2. Make the texts unique in that the spacing, text aligns, and images are different for the different sections and tie into the story.
3. Give the user enough options to tell different stories with the same narrative space.

NAME OF PROJECT: STILL UNTITLED

SUMMARY: Ideally something with Unity or Processing to create either a mini game or a useable asset for a future larger game (more of the Unity route). The reasoning for this is for use or inspiration in a larger project in the future. If it's a useable game asset from the Unity engine, I'd like to create something that could be used later; like a character animation code or a drivable/flyable vehicle code. However, if using a programming from Processing, I'd like to create a "more refined" program from an existing example that exists on Processing. An idea for this is to take the example titled "Planets" and make it so that Earth revolves around the sun as well; and perhaps even adding a planet or two and changing the textures of them to other planets.

FEATURES: 
For Processing Idea: 1. Adding a new planet to the "Planets" example. 2. Making Earth revolve around the Sun as well. 3. Scaling the planets to the relative acutal sizes, or at least still visable but not grotesquely oversized.
For the Unity Idea: 1. Create an animation for a future character model that can then be used in a wide array of NPC characters in an RPG. Something that could be applied to a skeletal mesh of a character to do a simple action, i.e. bend down, or wave.
