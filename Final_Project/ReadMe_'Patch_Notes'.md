NAME OF PROJECT: STILL UNTITLED

SUMMARY: Ideally something with Unity or Processing to create either a mini game or a useable asset for a future larger game (more of the Unity route). The reasoning for this is for use or inspiration in a larger project in the future. If it's a useable game asset from the Unity engine, I'd like to create something that could be used later; like a character animation code or a drivable/flyable vehicle code. However, if using a programming from Processing, I'd like to create a "more refined" program from an existing example that exists on Processing. An idea for this is to take the example titled "Planets" and make it so that Earth revolves around the sun as well; and perhaps even adding a planet or two and changing the textures of them to other planets.

FEATURES: 
For Processing Idea: 1. Adding a new planet to the "Planets" example. 2. Making Earth revolve around the Sun as well. 3. Scaling the planets to the relative acutal sizes, or at least still visable but not grotesquely oversized.
For the Unity Idea: 1. Create an animation for a future character model that can then be used in a wide array of NPC characters in an RPG. Something that could be applied to a skeletal mesh of a character to do a simple action, i.e. bend down, or wave.
